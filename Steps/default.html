		<p class="auto-style1">&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>We admitted we were 
		powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.</strong><br />
		<br />
		Do you feel like the waves of your addiction and the pressure to quit 
		are crashing in on you? Do you feel like the barn and the winds of life 
		and addiction are blowing you over? Because the barn is built stationary 
		and refuses to move from its foundation, it is destroyed! If, as an 
		addict, we would become more like the waves and be willing to roll and 
		be shapeless and willing to be changed, destruction wouldn&#39;t affect us.
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>How does one know when their lives have become unmanageable ?
		</strong><br />
		<br />
		Have you lost jobs, because you couldn&#39;t get up after days on binges? 
		Have you had DCS called in to check on your kid’s cause of your 
		addiction? Has your addiction landed you in jail more than once? Have 
		you lost marriages or spouses cause you wouldn&#39;t quit your drug of 
		choice? Have you become violent or aggressive towards family and 
		friends? What about seclusion? Have you isolated yourself from everyone, 
		from embarrassment or hoping that you can hide your problems? These are 
		all examples and questions that can help you understand if your life is 
		unmanageable! But don&#39;t despair there is hope!<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<br />
		<strong>How does someone admit powerlessness and to who?</strong><br />
		<br />
		Sometimes the only way one can admit being powerless is to be taken to a 
		low level of having things they really love taken or run away from them. 
		Periods of jail time or in rehabs give us time to stop and reflect. 
		Others will see it from deaths around them. The first person that you 
		have to admit it to is yourself; because until you realize it, nothing 
		anyone tries to do to help you will make a difference. You&#39;ve heard the 
		old saying, “<em>you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make them 
		drink</em>.” There&#39;s no truer saying to an addict.<br />
		<br />
		It&#39;s hard to admit defeat or powerlessness over something that many of 
		us, as addicts, cannot even recognize. We often think that everyone else 
		is the problem. <br />
		<br />
		As we move through these 12 steps, stop and think about you and no one 
		else around you! Know that you are not alone! All recovering addicts, 
		worldwide welcome you. One day at a time, one step in a focused and 
		sober mind. Each day will seem strange at first, keep in mind your 
		addiction didn&#39;t happen overnight and your recovery won&#39;t happen 
		overnight either, but if you will give your recovery as much attention 
		as you did your addiction, you will succeed. <br />
		<br />
		GOD grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the 
		courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the 
		difference. <br />
		<br />
