		<h2 class="auto-style1">About Rejoice and Recovery</h2>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Rejoice and Recovery is based in Doyle , Tennessee but 
		reaches out to surrounding county&#39;s.&nbsp; The men and women of R and R 
		also reach out to help our community by bringing 12 steps to the inmates 
		of White County Justice Center. This 12 Step Group&nbsp; meets every 
		Tuesday at 6 pm at Doyle Methodists Church.&nbsp; It is a faith based 
		Program that bodly leads people to recovery thru 12 Steps of AA , love 
		and understanding.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;12 Steps of AA and NA been around and proven that by taking an 
		inventory of yourself and with the help from other recovering addicts 
		,we can overcome this monster that many call ADDICTION.&nbsp; It will be 
		important that as you begin this that you take on the mind frame of a 
		child.&nbsp; As a child we were like a sponge and easily take in 
		information and accept it.&nbsp; As a child we weren&#39;t bound by science 
		or things we could see.&nbsp; A child was open to being with and around 
		others for support.&nbsp; So before you begin each day and step, please 
		open your heart and mind and spirit to an awakening of such proportions 
		that you thought were never possible.&nbsp; Stay positive and know that 
		some of these steps can be a challenge and maybe even bring you back to 
		places that hurt you, but don&#39;t get discouraged or let that pain keep 
		you in this prison of being out of control.&nbsp; Coping with these very 
		fears can be your avenue of success in recovery.&nbsp; Stay positive!&nbsp; </p>
		<p>&nbsp; Through out this site you will not only read pages from the Blue 
		Book of AA&nbsp; and NA, but also real life testimonies and suggestions from 
		people overcoming addiction just as we are.&nbsp; You&#39;re not alone and 
		that&#39;s why we are bringing 12 steps to you this way.&nbsp; Some may not 
		be able to get to meetings, so by the grace of GOD, my higher power, we 
		are bringing meetings to you in a way like never before.&nbsp; We will 
		remain and keep our privacy, as our recovery is no ones business.&nbsp; 
		We, Addicts are not trash, we are just broken and in need of guidance 
		for repair.&nbsp; Think about it this way, if your car is broken are you 
		going to take it to the cart pusher at your grocery store?&nbsp; NO, you 
		take it to a mechanic who has the knowledge and skills needed to repair 
		your car!&nbsp; This 12 step program is comprised of recovering addicts 
		and 12 steps and traditions that have proven to be effective.&nbsp; We 
		pride ourselves on our recovery and not ashamed of where we have been, 
		but come to a place of forgiveness, so we can begin a repair process and 
		take pride in everyday of sobriety.</p>
		<p>&nbsp; If today is your first day or your 50th year, we welcome you and 
		love you!&nbsp;</p>
